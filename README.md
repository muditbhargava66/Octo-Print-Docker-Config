This is a Docker Compose file for setting up OctoPrint, a web interface for 3D printers. OctoPrint allows you to control and monitor your 3D printer from any device that has a web browser.

## **Code**

```bash
version: '2'

services:

  octoprint:
    image: octoprint/octoprint:latest

    ports:
      - "5000:5000"

    environment:
      - TZ=America/New_York

    volumes:
      - /path/to/octoprint:/root/.octoprint

    devices:
      - /dev/serial/by-id/<dev_port_id>:/dev/ttyUSB0

    restart: unless-stopped
```

## **Changes to the Device Configuration**

In version 2 of the code, the **`devices`** section has been updated to specify the location of the connected 3D printer.

The line **`- /dev/serial/by-id/<dev_port_id>:/dev/ttyUSB0`** maps the USB device identified by the ID **`<dev_port_id>`** to the virtual device **`/dev/ttyUSB0`**.

## **Finding Your Connected Device**

To find the ID of your connected 3D printer, you can use the following command:

```bash
ls /dev/serial/by-id/
```

This will display a list of all connected serial devices, along with their IDs. Find the ID of your 3D printer and replace **`<dev_port_id>`** with your device's ID in the **`devices`** section of the code.

## **Use**

Copy and paste the code into a file named **`docker-compose.yml`** and use the following command to bring up the OctoPrint service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## **Final Thoughts**

With this Docker Compose file and the updated device configuration, you should be able to set up OctoPrint and control your 3D printer from any device with a web browser. If you have any issues or questions, feel free to reach out for support.
